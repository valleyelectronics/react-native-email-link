## Fixes
in iOS, canOpenUrl('mailto:foo@bar.com') returns true even though Mail app is not installed. (known bug)
and in this case, app crashes as it doesn't handle error in openInbox and openComposer methods.

---

An easy way to open an email app of the user's choice, based on the apps they have installed
on their device. Very helpful for magic link logins.

Currently supported apps:

- Apple Mail
- Gmail
- Inbox
- Spark
- Airmail
- Outlook
- Yahoo Mail
- Superhuman
- Yandex

## Installation

### 1. Install the package

```
yarn add react-native-email-link
```

This package works with autolinking on RN>=0.60. If you're using an earlier version of React Native, please install version `1.4.0` of the library, or
check out the legacy [rnpm](https://github.com/leanmotherfuckers/react-native-email-link/tree/rnpm) branch.

### 2. Post-install steps

Based on the platforms your app supports, you also need to:

<details>
<summary><strong>iOS – Update Info.plist</strong></summary>

To allow your app to detect if any of the mailbox apps are installed, an extra step is required on iOS. Your app needs to provide the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside `ios/{my-project}/Info.plist` to specify the URL schemes with which the app can interact.

Just add this in your `Info.plist` depending on which apps you'd like to support. Omitting these might mean that the library can't detect some of the maps apps installed by the user.

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>message</string>
    <string>readdle-spark</string>
    <string>airmail</string>
    <string>ms-outlook</string>
    <string>googlegmail</string>
    <string>inbox-gmail</string>
    <string>ymail</string>
    <string>superhuman</string>
    <string>yandexmail</string>
</array>
```

Using Expo? [Read the instructions](docs/expo.md) to make it work on iOS.

<details>
<summary><strong>Android – Update AndroidManifest.xml</strong></summary>

When switching to Android 11/Android SDK 30 (i.e. using Expo SDK 41), this library doesn't work out of the box anymore. The reason is the new [Package Visibilty](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility) security feature. We'll have to update our `AndroidManifest.xml` to explicitly allow querying for other apps.

You can do so by coping the `<queries>` statement below, and pasting it in the top level of your AndroidManifest (i.e. within the `<manifest> ... </manifest>`).

```xml
<queries>
  <intent>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <data android:scheme="mailto"/>
  </intent>
</queries>
```

<summary><strong>Expo – Update app.json</strong></summary>
